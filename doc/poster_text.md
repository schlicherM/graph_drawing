### Text
#### Colors
For each country, the map visualizes the distribution of medals won in each sports category at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2020. All participating countries are assigned to one of five distinct clusters, based on how similar their distribution of medals are (using K-means clustering with cosine distance). Each cluster is represented by one color on the map. The level of opacity of each coloring illustrates the total amount of medals won by each country using a logarithmic scale.
#### Edges
The white edges traverse the subsequent host cities of the Olympics and the gold, silver and bronze edges connect each venue to the countries that were awarded the most medals of the respective class.
#### Charts
The medal distributions across all sports categories that represent each cluster are visualized with radial charts and the countries on the world map are colored based on which cluster they belong to. The bar plots below each chart compare the (at most ten) countries that won the most medals in each cluster.
