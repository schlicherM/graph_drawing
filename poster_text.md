#### Colors
For each country, the map visualizes the distribution of medals won in each sports category at the Olympic Games from 1992 to 2020. All participating countries are assigned to one of five distinct clusters, based on how similar their distribution of medals are (using K-means clustering with cosine distance). Each cluster is represented by one color on the map. The level of opacity of each coloring illustrates the total amount of medals won by each country using a logarithmic scale.
